# Design Patterns in TypeScript #

Here are the implementations of the following design patterns in TypeScript:

## Creational Patterns ##

* [Prototype](https://github.com/miladvafaeifard/design-pattern-typescript-examples/tree/master/Prototype)

## Structural Patterns ##

## Behavioral Patterns ##

### Compile the project ###

```shell
git clone https://github.com/miladvafaeifard/design-pattern-typescript-examples.git
npm start -- <folder>/main.ts
```

There is a `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory which is responsible for the compiler options.

As it is set the default target is Ecmascript6 now.
